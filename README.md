## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The motivation for creating this project came about when the decision was made that I would like to change career paths, and building this starter project helped push me towards that goal.The specific purpose of this project was to learn the absolute fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Along the way there were many problems to solve, such as where to get certain programs that would allow me to write codes and store their progression. Aswell as problems of learning new content such as writing functions or what an array entails. A large problem I stumbled across was when I would load the website anew, sometimes the website would have errors in finding my css and js files. Meaning the HTML or index file content would load no issues but the assets folders contents would not. I scoured the internet forums looking for a solution to why my website was not loading important content. My solution was when linking those other external portions I hadn't typed a period before/assets/stylesheets Etc. These problems were solved through reading documentation and trial and error. I learned that a website is made up of three essential parts: HTML which are the bones. CSS which is the design and beautification of those bones and Javascript which is the moving and acting soul that inhabits those bones. All combined it creates an intense system that allows us to communicate and interact with the world.
